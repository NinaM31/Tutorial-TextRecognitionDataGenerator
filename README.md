## Introduction
This repo will be a simple tutorial on how to use [trdg](https://github.com/Belval/TextRecognitionDataGenerator). One issue I was facing is that the generated Arabic text was reversed ðŸ™ƒ. So In this tutorial I'll show you how to avoid this when using `GeneratorFromStrings`. 

## Getting started

```
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
``` 

## Data 
The data that I'll be using is this [Arabic Name](https://www.kaggle.com/lailamohammed/arabic-names)
